            <p class="blog-post-meta">Total suspects: 2</p>
            <hr>
            <p>There was not that many suspects but one group that a majority of people thought it could be was the Middle Eastern terrorists.
               The reason why they had suspsion is because the bombing that they did was only two years ago and people where still on edge from it.
             The second suspect was Timothy McVeigh and he later was founded guilty due the fact that a rear axle of Ryder truck was found and the vehicles idetification number traced it back to Junction City in Kansas. later the people who worked at the shop then was able to give a drawing of the man then later hotle employees where able to give a name. The next person is not a suspect but some that knew about the bombing before it took place, and he was freind of Timothy
           and he also was a solider and later surrederd to police and was convicted. </p>
